# Weather Dashboard

A sleek and modern weather dashboard application built with Next.js.

## How to Run

* Add a `.env` file with your `API_KEY` for weather.com (`e1f10a1e78da46f5b10a1e78da96f525` is one that is publicly available, and probably leaked in the past)
* Run the development server with `npm run dev` or build (`npm run build`) and start (`npm start`) the production server
* Alternatively, use Docker Compose with `docker-compose up --build` to run the application in a containerized environment. You'll still need to provide your `.env` file for environment variables.
